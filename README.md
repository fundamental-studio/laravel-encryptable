## Installation

The package is compatible with Laravel 7+ version.

Via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require fmtl-studio/laravel-encryptable
```

After installing, the package should be auto-discovered by Laravel.
In order to configurate the package, you need to publish the config file using this command:
``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Fundamental\Encryptable\EncryptableServiceProvider"
```

After publishing the config file, you should either add the needed keys to the global .env Laravel file:
```
EPAY_PRODUCTION=FALSE # Should the platform use the production or the test ePay endpoint
EPAY_MIN=XXXXXXXXXX # Official KIN number from the ePay platform
EPAY_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX # Secret token from the ePay platform
EPAY_DEFAULT_CURRENCY="BGN" # Default currency
EPAY_DEFAULT_URL_OK="https://myurl.com/"
EPAY_DEFAULT_URL_CANCEL="https://myurl.com/"
EPAY_GENERATE_INVOICE=TRUE # Should the package generate random invoice number if one isn't presented
EPAY_EXPIRATION_HOURS=72 # What is the period(in hours) that tha package should add to the current timestamp for an expiration date
```

You are up & running and ready to go.

## Documentation and Usage instructions

The usage of our package is pretty seamless and easy.
First of all, you need to use the proper namespace for our package:
```
use Fundamental\Epay\Epay;
```

Creating the instance of our package:
``` php
$epay = new Epay('paylogin', array $data, 'BG'); // Use either paylogin or credit_paydirect, the second parameter is documented in the next section and the third parameter is the request language page will be shown in: BG or EN, default: BG.
$epay->setData(
    1000000000, // Could be either number or false(will be auto-generated if EPAY_GENERATE_INVOICE=TRUE)
    40.00, // Amount of the payment, double formatted either as double or string
    '14.12.2019 20:46:00', // Could be either formatted date in d.m.Y H:i:s or false(will be auto-generated)
    'Description of the payment in less than 100 symbols.', // Could be empty
    'BGN', // Available currencies: BGN, USD, EUR, default to bgn, may be ommited
    'utf-8' // Encoding, either null or utf-8, may be ommitted
);
```
The setData function could be ommitted. The data may be set as array and second parameter to the constructor of the main class.
``` php
$epay = new Epay('paylogin', [
    'invoice' => 1000000000, // Could be either number or false(will be auto-generated if EPAY_GENERATE_INVOICE=TRUE)
    'amount' => 40.00, // Amount of the payment, double formatted either as double or string
    'expiration' => '14.12.2019 20:46:00', // Could be either formatted date in d.m.Y H:i:s or false(will be auto-generated)
    'description' => 'Description of the payment in less than 100 symbols.' // Could be empty
]);
```
All available methods are shown into the next section, including setter and getter methods.

Retrieve the correct and formatted hidden fields, form, or array with all the needed parameters.
``` php
// Both, URL OK and URL Cancel can be ommitted as not required by the ePay platform.

// Would return all hidden fields as formatted html
$epay->generatePaymentFields('https://ok.url', 'https://cancel.url');

// Would return html form with the first parameter as id
$epay->generatePaymentForm('#form-id', 'https://ok.url', 'https://cancel.url');

// Would return array with all needed parameters for the platform request you need to do on your own
$epay->getPaymentParameters();
```
All available methods are shown into the next section.

All current requests can be used as a form for redirecting the user to the ePay platform, including:
- Payment through your ePay account
- BPay code for ATM withdraw using 6 digit code
- Payment through debit/credit card throught ePay World (If ePay World is included into your ePay contract)
- EasyPay tab, which will give you 10 digit code for payment

However, if you need and want to integrate your platform with the EasyPay 10 digit code yourself, you can use:
``` php
// Using the initialization code from the upper piece of code
$easyPayIDN = $epay->requestIDNumber(); // Returning the 10 digit number for EasyPay payment or throws an exception
$epay->getEasypayIDN(); // Available method if needed and not assigned the requestIDNumber() to a variable
```

It is also possible to parse the return results and output them as array:
``` php
// Would like the $response array to have two members encoded and checksum.
$results = Fundamental\Epay\Epay::parseResult($response); // Will return full array of data, if the checksum check equals true
```

All available methods are shown into the next section.
